### Part I
# (1) Create a base class call Seq. Seq should have a constructor in initialize
#     and instance of Seq with sequence, gene name and species.
# (2) Create 2 methods for Seq.
#        1. print_record returns the sequence
#        2. overload the str function to return species, gene name : sequence
# 
# Test with the function calls below

### Part II
# (1) Create a class DNA that inherits Seq. In the constructor, use the super()
#        function to make the contructor. Add a variable gene_id and
#        add **kwargs also in the constructor
# (2) Add a method called analysis that returns then number of Gs and Cs
#
# Test with the function calls below

    def __init__(sequence="", gene="", species="", **kwargs):

        self.species = species
        
    def print_record(self):
        return self.sequence

    def __str__(self):
        return "Species:" + self.species + "\n" + str(self.gene_name) + ":" + str(self.sequence)

myseq=Seq("ATATAG","my_gene","H.sapiens")

#d=DNA("GATCTC","my_dna","D.terebrans","AX5667.2")
#d.print_record()
#print(d)

#d.source="Mexico"
#print(d.source)
#print(d.analysis())
